      	<h1>Summary</h1>
		    <p>Former marketer turned Web Developer looking to bring my strong sense of product and eye for appealing content into my new career. I'm upbeat, creative, hard working, and I thrive in an environment that matches my pace - especially if there are office dogs. I’ve become enamoured with JavaScript (especially React), love the ease of SASS, and have brought my strict organizational and communication skills forward in my career to create clean, DRY and well documented code. Hoping to join a small team in Vancouver where my voice and input can make an impact.</p>
